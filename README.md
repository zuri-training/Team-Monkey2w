My_Debtors Web Application
Idea Brief 

          My_debtor web application is a finance management and an academic growth platform that deals with taking records of each student’s directory so as to keep track of students who are in debt and preventing them from moving to another school whilst still being indebted to their former schools. This is for schools in the same locality. 

Client : School Owners

Role : Product Designers
Research Background
       There are so many cases whereby school owners incur financial losses when students owe them for their educational support. So many schools try reaching out to the guardians of these students individually but all to no avail. These issues are compounded when schools are unable to track down the guardians and collect the necessary financial support from them.  These are issues that constantly diminish the school owners’ good interest in continual efforts of successful operations. My_debtor web application is a platform that would help these schools (secondary schools) maintain students’ financial records in order to distinguish students in debt from the other students and also the schools that are yet to admit these said students in debt would be able to see each student’s payment history or financial records of their previous school. Now, this product (my_debtor) would also improve the relationships between schools in the same locality as the database serves as a linkage supporting each school’s accountability.
