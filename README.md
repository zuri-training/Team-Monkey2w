# My_Deptors Web Application
## Idea Brief 
   My_debtor web application is a finance management and an academic growth platform that deals with taking records of each student’s directory so as to keep track of students who are in debt and preventing them from moving to another school whilst still being indebted to their former schools. This is for schools in the same locality. 

**Client** : School Owners <br>
**Role** : Product Designers
## Research Background
   There are so many cases whereby school owners incur financial losses when students owe them for their educational support. So many schools try reaching out to the guardians of these students individually but all to no avail. These issues are compounded when schools are unable to track down the guardians and collect the necessary financial support from them.  These are issues that constantly diminish the school owners’ good interest in continual efforts of successful operations. My_debtor web application is a platform that would help these schools (secondary schools) maintain students’ financial records in order to distinguish students in debt from the other students and also the schools that are yet to admit these said students in debt would be able to see each student’s payment history or financial records of their previous school. Now, this product (my_debtor) would also improve the relationships between schools in the same locality as the database serves as a linkage supporting each school’s accountability.

## THE PROCESS
   The team's designers conducted qualitative and quantitative user research to completely understand the demands, pain points, and expectations of the majority of users of the content management system. The designers conducted qualitative and quantitative user research. Throughout the study procedure, a questionnaire survey was issued. <br>

The designers came to the conclusion that great design focuses on more than merely appearances. They attract visitors and assist people in understanding the product, industry, and branding using a range of indications, including graphics, text, and interactions, highlighting the fact that every piece of the website must work towards a clear aim. Through a range of indicators, including graphics, text, and interactions, they draw visitors and assist people in understanding the product, company, and branding. This strongly implies that every component of the website must contribute to the achievement of a certain objective. This was accomplished by the design team using a comprehensive approach to web design that focuses on both form and function.<br> 

The procedure for creating high-fidelity designs for the web application is as follows:

- Empathize
- Define
- Ideate
- Prototype
- Test

## Features
   MY_debtors is a platform that allows schools in defined locality to list the directory of people owing them to help them avoid going to other schools. Here is a list of the attributes we are aiming for:<br>
**User**: Unauthenticated
1. Visit the platform to view basic information about it
2. View and interact with the documentation
3. Register to view more details
4. No access to data

**User**: Authenticated
1. Full access to the platform
2. Verify details before full access to platform
3. Post new data about a debtor
4. Allow debtors to challenge-contend
5. Comment on post by others
6. Copy should be disabled

## THE DESIGN TEAM
   The designers have started a series of UX research to determine the optimal use case for our product. These will help us get an understanding of what potential users could need. The design team used the usual design method in the sequence shown below to accomplish this.

- User research and surveys
- Data gathering and analysis
- Empathy diagrams
- Pain points 
- Idea generation and sketching
- Creation of user personas
- Developing user stories
- Designing user flows

## THE CHOSEN DESIGN TOOLS
   The collaborative aspect of "Figma" made it simple for the designers to monitor task statuses and make adjustments as needed, so they decided to employ it. Additionally, the designers put up a team workspace where everyone could collaborate on pages and concepts.<br>

The use of Figma has made it possible to collaborate easily and translate design into code.<br>

Google Forms were used to create questionnaires for user research. <br>

## MOOD BOARD
   Creating a mood board gives us a sense of what the end product will look like and lets everyone on the team agree on a direction before getting too far into the project. It also helps to eliminate any misconceptions that may arise from  describing a design concept verbally. <br>

## THE DEVELOPERS’ TEAM
The Developers were in charge of developing the logic behind the website's functionalities as well as bringing the designs created by the Design team to life. <br>
- Frontend Developer using HTML, JAVASCRIPT, CSS
- Backend Developer using Python
- Code Hosting Platform and Project Management using GitHub
- Live Server used to test Pages using Google Chrome

## BACKEND FUNCTION

### DATA SCHEMA
A database schema specifies how data is arranged in a relational database, including logical constraints such as table names, fields, data types, and the connections between these entities. <br>

## THE CHALLENGE

The team was initially assigned 18 students by Zuri Coordinator to work together for the 2 week project phase duration. Unfortunately, only 11 amongst the total number are “ACTIVE”, and as such, the only backend assigned to us falls under the “INACTIVE” participants of our team (Team Monkey 2w). Several messages have been dropped by the Team lead on the relevant Slack channels but no response or assistance has been received so far. <br>
Considering that some task requirements would need a Back end skill set to complete them, Zuri’s prompt assistance will be most appreciated please.


## CONCLUSION
Despite the obstacles, the Team overcame some of them and the challenge is currently slowly making progress toward the goal. However, the entire team is eagerly anticipating the release of this lovely experience project work. <br>

We extend our gratitude to the Zuri Team.
